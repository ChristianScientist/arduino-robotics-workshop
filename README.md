Arduino Robotics Workshop
=========================

This repo contains the source code samples and other files that I use for my [Robotics using Arduino workshop](http://hardwarefun.com/arduino-workshop).

About Workshop
-------------

I conduct an Arduino workshop which consists of hands-on sessions, where you can learn about Arduino and then use that knowledge to build a fully autonomously bot from scratch.

You can find the dates for the next batch and other details about the workshop [here](http://hardwarefun.com/arduino-workshop).
